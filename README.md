# BattleshipTesting
Hey there, I wanted to build a small project for the end of the summer, and I had the idea of testing different methods of guessing in the popular game, "Battleship".
The process is straight-forward and currently in progress.

Step 1: Build a script to generate a random board filled with 5 ships on it. - DONE
Step 2: Ask people what their go-to method for guessing is.
Step 3: Translate methods into code, and implement them.
Step 4: Run lots of tests and compare efficiency against each other
